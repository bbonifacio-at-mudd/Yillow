                    <p>For any data science project, acquiring the right dataset forms the crux of the journey.
                        In the case of 'Yillow: A Parody of Zillow', our desired dataset needed to be comprehensive, 
                        varied, and representative of the current housing market.</p>

                    <h2>Data Sources</h2>
                    <p>To continue the theme of being a parody of Zillow, the inspiration behind this project, the data was responsibly
                        gathered from Zillow's own website. This was performed via respectful web scraping, 
                        with deliberate multisecond delays between web requests to ensure no undue burden on the Zillow website. 
                        The process was carried out through original code in Python and was designed to minimize disruption while still
                         gathering the data necessary for the project.</p>

                    <h2>Single-Family Houses</h2>
                    <p>The first dataset is a robust collection of sold single-family houses in Washington, consisting of approximately
                         2,000 homes. To achieve a varied and representative sample, the data was broken down by the number of bedrooms 
                         - from one up to five bedrooms. For each category, data from 20 pages was collected, ensuring a well-rounded 
                         dataset that covered a range of home sizes.</p>

                    <p>The second dataset mirrors the first but focuses on manufactured homes instead. This dataset was acquired in a
                         similar fashion, offering an interesting contrast to the single-family home data.</p>

                    <p>These two datasets, meticulously and respectfully collected, provided the raw materials for this project.
                         They offered a solid foundation for in-depth data analysis and robust model development, enabling me to
                          uncover intriguing insights about the housing market, develop 'Yestimate', and ultimately embark on the hunt for my dream home.
